# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
I would like to be be an expert at selling myself. More full stack than front end. And have some extra side projects that I ma proud of.

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
I need to practice Whiteboarding to myself, I need to practice elevator pitch to myself, I need to pracitice positive affirmation. I need to learn python and build apps with express.

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
I am going to continue to make Turing my priority while not burning myself out. 

#### Opportunities Research:
I will make a new Trello Board everytime I send out cold outreach. I am going to gain inspiration more from what is actually in Colorado. I need to research the Boulder tech scene, and 500% more meet ups!

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
I need to reach out to more alumni, do demo-nights, and cold outeach people in the Boulder community. I also wnat to tech interview pracrtice at Mojotech.

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
More twitter, better LinkedIn, and a fun feature on my personal site.

### Timeline:
I will have a job by the 5th week of Mod4

#### Module Tasks:
4hours everyday of job-hunt, 4 hours everyday of coding. Two up front, two extra time.

#### Weekly Tasks:
Redo Trello, new meet-ups, and finish one new side project.
